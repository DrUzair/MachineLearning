1. Covariance Matrix Calculation using X^T * X

Step 1: Start with a data matrix X.

Step 2: Compute the mean of each column in X to obtain Mean(X).

Step 3: Subtract Mean(X) from X to obtain X_centered.

Step 4: Compute X_centered^T * X_centered.

Step 5: Divide by n-1 to obtain the covariance matrix: Cov(X) = (1/(n-1)) * X_centered^T * X_centered.

2. Pairwise Dot-Product Matrix Calculation using X^T * X

Step 1: Start with a data matrix X.

Step 2: Compute the length (L2 norm) of each column in X to obtain Length(X).

Step 3: Divide each column in X by its corresponding length in Length(X) to obtain X_normalized.

Step 4: Compute X_normalized^T * X_normalized to obtain the pairwise dot-product matrix.

3. Role of X^T * X in Support Vector Machines (SVM)

In SVM, the objective function often includes a term that can be written as x^T * Q * x, where Q is a matrix computed using the data matrix X. Q can be influenced by the operation X^T * X, but no centering or normalization is required by the model itself.

Preprocessing the data by scaling (not centering) can still be beneficial for SVMs as SVMs are not scale invariant. A common practice is to scale each feature to have zero mean and unit variance.
